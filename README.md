## UL Potluck API Code Challenge

A menu was added to the challenge. If you know your API key, you can revisit the list and add items that way. Otherwise, you will need to add another email address. The exit options aren't breaking cleanly, and will need some extra time.

You may use these recorded API keys:

`{ id: 38, email: user@host.com, api_key: e733770a7ef3de6b4c931c6826fba960 }`
`{ id: 39, email: test@host.com, api_key: 4e52547266c2e73a8eb3a215b8b1a947 }`
